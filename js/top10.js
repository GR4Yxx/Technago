const Headphone_descriptions=["One of the best-designed headphones in the list, the Sennheiser Momentum 3 offers fantastic sound and are easily customizable thanks to the companion app. However, they’re let down by measly 17-hour battery life and their high price.In terms of sheer sound quality, the headphones sound brilliant, with high levels of detail, warm bass, and natural-sounding highs. The customizable noise cancellation is good, but it doesn’t quite reach the class-leading standards set by the Sony WH-1000XM3 Wireless headphones.","What do you get when you take the QC35 and add a dedicated button to activate Google Assistant? You get the QC35 II, of course. You get the standard Bose fare with the QC35 II – good sound quality, comfort and not to forget, the class-leading noise cancellation technology. To round it all up, the battery life is great, too. If you're looking to save some money, however, consider the original Bose QuietComfort 35. They can also be found for far cheaper these days, and if you're not fussed about having Google Assistant built into your headphones then you can save yourself some money while you save up for QC35 II.","With the Crusher ANC, Skullcandy tries to take the bass to the next level. The Crusher ANC is the successor to the Crusher 360 and adds Active Noise Cancellation to the mix. Also, Skullcandy brings the ability to personalize sound using the app while still delivering the bone-rattling bass. The bass on the Crusher ANC is like a double-edged sword, it struggles at higher volumes, and the plastic build doesn't feel as premium compared to the Crusher 360 which came with a metal build. On the positive side, the Crusher ANC offers 24 hours of battery life with quick charge support. One unique design feature is the integrated Tile tracker, which is handy if you often misplace your headphones.","Want something that offers great battery life, style and a lot of customization options? The Jabra Elite 85h has answers for all your needs. That said, purists will bemoan the lack of high-end codec support and there are punchier headphones on the market at this price point.However, when you consider that Jabra’s Elite 85h headphones are Bose’s first attempt at premium wireless ANC headphones, the result is quite commendable. We can’t wait to see what the company’s next premium ANC headphones will accomplish. If you want an alternative to Sony's WH-1000XM3, this is it.","Sony’s 1000X series of headphones have been our favourite for years now. Thanks to a combination of aptX and LDAC wireless codecs, in conjunction with Sony’s noise cancellation techniques, we’ve come to love Sony’s 1000X range of headphones. Whether you travel a lot or want to shut the outside world off, the 1000X series offers just what you need. The M2 could suffice your needs, but the M3 throws in improved noise cancellation algorithms and a touch of style to make the upgrade worth it. ","If you are looking for a pair of wireless headphones that don’t burn through your pocket, the Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC headphones could be what you’re looking for. They offer decent noise cancellation that justifies the price. They may not be as powerful as the Sony WH-1000XM3 or sound as great as the Amiron, but these Sennheiser headphones offer good value for money","Audio-Technica has a rich history when it comes to class-leading high-end audio products. The ATH-M50xBT carry that legacy forward while cutting the cord, delivering studio-quality audio experience sans the wires. The ATH-M50xBTs are designed for really high-end audio performance, with 45mm drivers and a frequency response range of 15-28,00 Hz, and it shows - we were very impressed with the warm, well-rounded sound. The ATH-M50xBT headphones also performed well in terms of battery life and Bluetooth connectivity. The one area where they aren’t up to snuff is the microphone – it is not strong enough and you may end up struggling to make phone calls with them. That said, these are studio-grade headphones and you’d probably not buy them for phone calls, so they are still great when it comes to their primary task.","If you travel a lot and want something that can last really long and block out all the external noise, then let us introduce you to the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2. These headphones are one of the few ones on the market that can do all of the above and still cost a fraction of what headphones from big players like Sony, Bose and Beats cost. To maximise battery life, Plantronics has added a special feature that turns these headphones off when you are not wearing them. To make it simple, the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2 offer great battery life, sound good, have great noise cancellation on offer and carry an affordable price tag.","One of the most affordable noise-cancelling headphones in the market. The Sony WH-CH710N is priced under Rs 10,000. Instead of the conventional active noise cancelling technique, these offer noise cancellation using Artificial Intelligent (AINC). Sony claims 35-hour battery life with noise cancellation but, in our testing, we could get even more. It also offers a quick charge via Type-C port. For connectivity, there is Bluetooth 5.0 and also NFC. The mids and lows are on the lower frequencies. Overall, I felt that they sounded flat more often than not. However, the loud music makes it up in many cases. The dual-microphone does a pretty decent job here. These are worth considering if you’re looking for a headphone with noise cancellation under Rs 10,000.","Last on the list is the most affordable headphones on too. Boat is one of the most popular brands in India which makes accessories like headphones, earphones, Bluetooth speakers, and much more. The Boat Rockerz 600 headphones are quite popular with youngsters and the two main reasons being - affordable price and powerful punchy bass. The Boat Rockerz 600 features 40 mm drivers to produce punchy bass and can last up to 8 hours on a single charge, which is good for the price. It features soft earcups for a comfortable fit but, the fit may be too tight for some people. Apart from that, they are very easy to carry around as they come with foldable design. Overall materials used is also quite good and overall sound quality is pretty much good. The headphones are more suited for people who prefer bass. "]

const Mobile_descriptions=["Samsung did not hold anything back with Galaxy Note20 Ultra. As you might expect from the highest-end flagship from the brand, you get the best possible features you can find on an Android phone in 2020 with the Note20 Ultra. The handset offers up to 120Hz display refresh rate, top-of-the-line processor, and ample memory to name a few. You are also treated to a premium design and great cameras that are capable of capturing some brilliant clicks in any lighting situation. Notably, the S Pen is better than ever too.","The latest and the greatest iPhone from Apple comes with such horsepower that even PCs can start sweating at this point. Although everybody expected Apple to include some standout pathbreaking features with the new iPhones, the iPhone Pro Max was launched with key improvements across the board. The handset comes with an improved display, battery life, and even camera performance. There were several doubts raised last year over the brand's claims to be the best in optics but with iPhone Pro Max, Apple truly managed to deliver a knockout punch to the critics.","Samsung's Galaxy S series flagship phone from 2020 comes with the high-end industry features, including a display with 120Hz refresh rate. As you might expect with Samsung's expertise in displays, the S20 Plus comes with one of the best panels ever seen on a smartphone. Along with this, you get the best chipset on any Android phone, a massive battery backup, extremely capable camera setup, and a punch-hole design. If you are going for an Android phone, you cannot go wrong with this one.","Probably the most popular iPhone model of recent times, the iPhone 11 doesn't dig as deep a hole in your pocket as some of the recent flagships from the brand have. The iPhone 11 comes with dual rear cameras and is one of the most capable camera smartphones available in the market. If you are not interested in clicking pictures, no worries, the handset ships with A13 Bionic chipset, which is the most powerful mobile chipset available in the industry right now. The phone offers a great battery life and a great display quality too. On the software side, the phone delivers like a true champ too.","It should hardly come as a surprise that the latest and greatest phone from OnePlus actually makes this list. The brand has been growing quickly ever since its launch and its latest phone offers a high refresh rate display, top-of-the-line processor, premium design, and great software. There are many phones that feature great hardware but software usually bogs down the package but with OnePlus, you get the best software experience on an Android phone, barring Pixel handsets.","Xiaomi's flagship handset comes with a modern design, 90Hz display refresh rate, and a flagship-grade processor. You also get good battery backup. However, the most impressive aspect about this phone is the camera department. The handset offers cameras that can take detailed pictures that can rival those taken from most other premium end smartphones. If you have used MIUI before, you'll feel right at home but with an even less intrusive interface.","Huawei P30 Pro turned out to be the unlikely contender that displaced iPhone XS Max from the top spot in this list. The new handset from Huawei comes with incredible features like 50x zoom, reverse charging, and excellent low-light imaging capabilities. Arguably the best-looking smartphone in the market, the P30 Pro comes with a quad-camera setup that allows it to produce pictures that can, at times, rival DSLR cameras as well. Huawei’s P30 Pro is the best Android handset to come in a very long time and offers good performance on all fronts.","OnePlus has the habit of launching flagship-killer phones and although the brand is itself getting good competition off-late, there is no denying that its latest offering, i.e. OnePlus 7T, is one of the best handsets to launch in 2019. When you consider that OnePlus 7T comes with a 90Hz display, 30W fast charging, the top-of-the-line chipset, and a premium design, at a much lower price point than most flagships, you'll have to ponder over the thought of spending a premium for other handsets in the market and the additional value they bring along.","When a handset offers the top-of-the-line chipset available in the market for half the price of most flagships, there is little room left for nitpicking. Realme X2 Pro doesn't just feature a great processor but offers an extremely capable camera setup, headlined by a whopping 64MP camera sensor. The top features don't end here as the flagship from Realme comes with a 90Hz display, which provides a butter-smooth user experience. It won't be wrong to say that Realme has gained the reputation of new flagship killer in the market with Realme X2 Pro.","After launching OnePlus X with underwhelming specifications and getting a lower-than-usual response from customers, the brand definitely learnt its lesson. OnePlus Nord is one of the best mid-range smartphones available in the market and offers an experience that you would usually expect from a flagship. While the brand is not offering the best chipset in the market with the Nord, everything else seems to be on point. You get good camera performance, decent battery life, high refresh display, and a UI that makes everything work smoothly."]

The earphones are quite sturdy and robust owing to their tangle-free fabric cables and metal build. They also come equipped with a sizable three-year warranty period. The in-ears are lightweight and inconspicuous, weighing a mere 14g. The earphones also come with seven sets of ear tips to ensure that every user is able to find the perfect fit for their individual ears.

The subtle-looking earphones are one of the best in-ear headphones below Rs 2000 which produce a refined and neutral sound that audiophiles will absolutely fall in love with. The earphones are also supremely comfortable, lightweight, and have an understated but sophisticated look. Additionally, you also get various ear tips sizes to ensure you find the perfect fit. The only con is the lack of in-line controls and a microphone.","If you’re someone who can make do without silicone tips, the San Francisco earphones by the company Urbanista is an excellent choice. Featuring a V-shaped sound signature that enhances the bass and the treble, the Urbanista San Francisco sports solid separation between the frequencies and ensures that the music sounds clean and well-defined. The earphones are also pretty lightweight, so wearing them for extended periods of time will not adversely affect your ears. They also come equipped with flat cables which are less prone to tangles.","The Audio-Technica ATH-AX1iS is part of Audio-Technica’s Sonic Fuel range of headphones.

It offers thumping and loud audio without distortion at high volumes; is light enough to carry on a camping trip but remains durable enough to tumble in a bag unprotected. There are certainly more detailed speakers out there (see: Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin down below), but at a price that's relatively affordable to all, the UE Boom 3 hits all the right notes for the third year in a row.","JBL is a very well-known name when it comes to audio accessories, and the company maintains its reputation with the Charge 3. As a package, the JBL Charge 3 offers a compelling set of features and excellent sound quality to boot. It punches well above its weight, playing it loud and distortion-free.The Charge line of speakers have been on our shortlist of recommendations for a long time and the latest iteration maintains JBL’s dominance in the portable Bluetooth speaker market.","The Bose SoundLink Mini II is more than four years old now, making it ancient by modern standards of consumer electronics. However, writing off the SoundLink Mini II because of this would be a mistake, given the fact that it still is one of the best sounding wireless speakers. The SoundLink Mini II punches way above what its size would suggest, offering deep bass, fizzy highs and a lush midrange. It proves that small speakers don’t always have to compromise on the sound quality.","Another entry from UE in our list, the UE Wonderboom is a great option if you are looking for a quality Bluetooth speaker that you can carry outdoors. UE has taken the Roll 2 and fixed most of the flaws that you could notice. In our eyes, the UE Wonderboom bests the Roll 2 in just about every way.

Skip the Kilburn if you cannot compromise on these two aspects – the Kilburn is heavy and doesn’t offer any sort of water resistance.However, if your primary concern is sound quality, you cannot go wrong with the Kilburn. It might seem a bit pricey, but the audio performance and the retro looks are worth it.","As the name suggests, the JBL Flip 4 is an outdoor-friendly, rough-and-tough speaker that lets you focus on enjoying your moments without worrying about the speaker.While its easy to carry the Flip 4 around without worrying too much, its sound quality isn’t really up to scratch, all things considered.","boAt is another well-known name when it comes to accessories.

Its rugged design and water resistance mean you can be carefree and live in the moment without having to worry about its safety.","The Sony Extra Bass SRS-XB10 is another tumbler design entry in this list.
